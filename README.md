# Front End Software Engineer Challenge and Questions

You are building the landing page for a SaaS cloud application, your users need to know the following
- Username
- Tenant
- Current Location in the cloud (e.g. Home)
- Cloud Applications (e.g. Email, Storage, Photo Library, Device Catalog, Subscription Manager) they have access to


Make sure that every URL in the landing page is well-formatted, do not worry about creating target pages; they can break or encounter a 404. The goal of this exercise is to allow the user to infer as much information as possible in as little time as possible.

**Minimum Requirements**
- Access every application from the landing page
- Surface mock-data from each application (e.g. show 5 recent emails, remaining storage, number of photos, etc.)
- Actions on mock-data (e.g. delete one or more emails.)
- The action should be realized on the landing page but it does not have to survive reloads (e.g. deleted emails are removed.)
- Use Functional React

**Bonus**
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript
- Anything to enhance UX


You may also use 3rd party component libraries.


This is essentially a blank-paper, your solution will be evaluated on UX, adherence to react core-concepts and tools used.

**Useful Tools & Links**

NOTE: Every example mentioned in the exercise is just that, an example. You neither have to use the same features nor the same number of features. This task should take approximately 2 hours.


**We also have some additional questions that help us get more insight into a candidate:**

1. What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something
   you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d
   love to know why you’re proud of it.

   => My proudest achievement is leading the development of a React Native app for Gulf oil refinery incident reporting. This project was incredibly fulfilling because it had a direct impact on improving safety measures and response times in the oil refinery industry. By implementing this app, we were able to provide a platform for workers to report incidents in real-time, enabling swift action to be taken to mitigate risks and ensure the safety of everyone involved. Knowing that our work contributed to maintaining safety measures and potentially saving lives fills me with immense pride and satisfaction.

2. What's a personal project you're currently working on? This could be a
   coding side project, hobby, or otherwise real world project you're working
   on.

   => Currently, I'm deeply engaged in learning AI/ML to expand my expertise in the field of artificial intelligence. This personal project has been a captivating journey as I explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques to understand their applications across different domains. My goal is to harness the power of AI to automate processes and tasks, ultimately enhancing efficiency and productivity in various real-world scenarios. It's an exciting endeavor that allows me to delve into cutting-edge technologies and explore their potential to revolutionize the way we work and interact with technology.

3. Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked
   it, and why we should read it.

   =>The article "When to use REST, gRPC, or Pub-Sub in microservice architecture" offers clear guidance on selecting the appropriate communication protocol for microservices. It succinctly outlines the strengths and use cases for each protocol: REST for immediate response scenarios, gRPC for low latency and high throughput environments, and Pub-Sub for asynchronous, event-driven architectures. By understanding these distinctions, developers can make informed decisions to optimize system performance and scalability in their microservices architecture.

4. Tell us about one of your favorite products (physical or software) and one
   specific aspect that makes it truly great.

   => One of my favorite software products is GitHub, a platform for version control and collaboration on software development projects. What makes GitHub truly great is its seamless integration with a wide range of development tools and workflows. GitHub's robust ecosystem allows developers to streamline their workflows, automate tasks, and maintain high code quality. Additionally, GitHub's integration with project management tools, like GitHub Projects, enables teams to sync boards with GitHub issues, facilitating efficient project tracking and task management. This combination of powerful features and integrations makes GitHub an invaluable tool for modern software development teams.
